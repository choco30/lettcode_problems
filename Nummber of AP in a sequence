#To find the total no of AP that can be formed from a given array

#Approach The Ap should be of at least 3 number long so, constitue a new array where each postion of array define the no of AP that can be formed till that index Number

Initialize the first two position as 0 as no AP can be formed till that number 

iterate from range(2, len(arry))

if for aposition difference between current posi no and prev posi no is same as diff between prev posi no and (prev posi no -1) than that meeen they are in AP

so, we can say that we find a new AP , so total no of till that number is prev Ap formaulated +1(as new ap can be combine with them and it formaulate one on its own)

        dp[0]=0
        dp[1]=0
        for i in range(2,size):
            if (nums[i]-nums[i-1])==(nums[i-1]-nums[i-2]):
                dp[i]=dp[i-1]+1
        return sum(dp)
